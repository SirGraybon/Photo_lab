# Photolab
### Graydon Ritchie

PhotoLab is a simple, single-page photo viewing application inspired by Instagram.  built using react, this project was taken on as a learning endeavour and I am excited to share the results with you! This project is presented in a modern minimalist style with tastefull CSS styling.
